This vscode extension tries to add changelog information to the hovered `package.json` package dependency.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

Just hover over a `package.json` dependency as seen in this GIF and the extension tries to fetch additional changelog information.

## ðŸ‘€ Known Issues

This extension tries to fetch the changelog data from [changelog.md](https://changelogs.md/) and from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3).

Since the current GitHub API has a rate limit of 60 requests per ip address the releases requests break and you have to wait one hour untill the extension works again appropriately. Please be aware that some projects don't provide a changelog or manage it at different places.

## ðŸ‘ŒCredits

- This extension uses the API from https://changelogs.md/ created by [Nathan Peck](https://github.com/nathanpeck)
- Big thx to [Filipe Santos Correa](https://github.com/Safi1012) for the icon ðŸ˜Š
